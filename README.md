**Javascript Social** is a framework independent simple to use, end-to-end, token-based authentication module with built-in support for Google, Facebook,
LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, GitHub, Bitbucket, Yahoo, Twitch, Microsoft (Windows Live) OAuth providers, as well as Email
and Password sign-in. However, you are not limited to the sign-in options above, in fact
you can add any *OAuth 1.0* or *OAuth 2.0* provider by passing provider-specific information
in the app *config* block.

This is ported from (https://github.com/sahat/satellizer)[satellizer].
